Tangent (name Bee Kunselman) is a biotechnician currently working under the contractor of the MSMC 601st Detachment, stationed with them on Hercynia to complete her assigned secondary objective (Discovery). She is trained in use of mechanized chassis for self-defense purposes, as well as to assist the 601st Detachment in their primary objective (Defend). She is a distinctly talented biotechnician, to the point of being capable of independantly developing non-human persons (NHPs), such as her personal SERVANT-Class NHP "Honey", which shares a name with her mechanized chassis. In combat, she sometimes utilizes an extremely volatile tactic in which she ejects from her mechanized chassis and leaves her NHP to control it, and then jockeys onto an opposing mechanized chassis and utilizes her knowledge of mech engineering to tear of vital components. Thankfully, she is talented in mech ejection protocols, and is capable of utilizing spare overshields to defend herself from attacks post-ejection.

Currently, she possesses a Rank I license in the IPS-Northstar Kidd, although she pilots a General Massive Systems SP-1 "Everest".
