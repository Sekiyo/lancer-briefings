Frontliner (alias Rico Burges) is a MSMC mercenary, currently within the 601st Detachment of it. He is skilled with close-quarter-combat and melee weaponry, and at remaining hidden on the battlefield while in a mechanized chassis. He is capable of designing custom ammunitions for his mechanized chassis, providing an additional kick; this most frequently sees use in the form of alternative ammunitions for his shotguns. Notably, he appears rather unlucky; however, in the circumstances he is lucky, he is especially so.

Currently, he possesses a Rank I license in the IPS-Northstar Blackbeard, although he pilots a General Massive Systems SP-1 "Everest".
