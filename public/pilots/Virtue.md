Virtue (alias Landon Michaelson) is the attending lawyer (under the "David and Goliath, Esq." legal team) deployed with the 601st Detachment of Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company. Despite his status as a member of Mirrorsmoke's legal team, he is trained in utilization of mechanical chassis for self-protection purposes (although he appears to utilize this more primarily to assist his assigned mercenaries in combative action). In addition to a notable (and obvious) prowess for legal work and his knack for knowing when someone is being deceitful, he is also an extremely talented hacker, which he frequently utilizes in the battlefield to assist his allies.

Currently, he possesses a Rank II license in the HORUS Goblin pattern-group, and pilots one as well.

As the attending lawyer for the 601st Detachment, he has some level of authority in non-combative circumstances, although the presiding Board Officer (presently Monsoon) and the contractor may overrule his orders.
