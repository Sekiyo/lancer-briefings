Solstice (alias Emyle Smith) is the Board Officer/Commanding Officer of the 470th Detachment of Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company. She is a skilled lancer and an ace pilot, often favoring mechanized chassis with high speed and manueverability.

// FURTHER DETAILS TO BE ATTACHED //

Currently, she possesses a Rank II license in the Smith-Shimano Corpo Dusk Wing, and pilots one as well.

The assigned Legal Officer of the 470th Detachment has recently been reported deceased, so Solstice is temporarily on substitute-assignment with the Legal Officer accompanying the 601st Detachment on Hercynia, known as Virtue (alias Landon Michaelson). After the binding contract of the 470th Detachment is fulfilled, Solstice will be available for extraction; however, it is estimated that the contract terms of the 601st Detachment and the 470th Detachment will be complete within a one-week timespan of eachother, and so it is advisable that both parties are extracted simulatenously rather than sending for a secondary extraction vessel.
