MacGuffin (alias Drake) is a MSMC mercenary, currently within the 601st Detachment of it. He is noted for his brute strength and stamina, capable of performing nigh-superhuman feats with only minor harm to self. His mechanized chassis functions much the same, frequently tearing pieces of the environment from the ground to use as cover, and relying on brute strength to maim opposing chassis. Despite his strength, it should be noted that he is not fully a "brute"; he possesses notable agility as well, and he is well-versed in the tactical side of combat, frequently able to reduce harm to himself with quick reaction times and reinforced hulls. However, he is not particularly talented in non-combative fields, as is to be expected of anyone in the same circumstances as him.

Currently, he possesses a Rank I license in the IPS-Northstar Zheng, although he pilots a General Massive Systems Sagarmatha.
