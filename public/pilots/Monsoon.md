Monsoon (alias Charles Whitman) is the Board Officer/Commanding Officer of the 601st Detachment of Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company. He possesses a great talent for engineering, and is known for keeping his mechanical chassis in a nigh-constant state of overheating to amplify offensive capability. He is also capable of engineering his own weaponry for his mechanical chassis. He seems to possess a great talent for escape art.

Currently, he possesses a Rank I license in the Smith-Shimano Corpo Monarch, although he pilots a salvaged Genghis Mk1 "Worldkiller" chassis.

Due to his ranking, he is the present authority for the actions of the 601st Detachment, although given sufficient reason he may be overruled by his current contractor.
